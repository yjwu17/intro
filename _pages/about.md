**About Me**

Dr. Yujie Wu is currently a Research Assistant Professor at PolyU. His research interests encompass a wide range of areas, focusing on brain-inspired artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, neuromorphic computing, and machine learning algorithms. He is dedicated to exploring the computational principles of the brain, with a specific emphasis on underlying learning mechanisms such as Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Behavioral Time-Scale Plasticity (BTSP). His goal is to develop cutting-edge brain-inspired general intelligence that possesses exceptional computational and learning efficiency, including robustness, adaptability, and few-shot learning capabilities.

In the past five years, Dr. Wu has conducted four main lines of research:

1. **High-performance training algorithms for deep spiking neural networks**
2. **Memory models to understand the brain's BTSP mechanism**
3. **Design of hybrid neural network architectures with complementary advantages**
4. **Navigation robot research oriented towards embodied AI**
